# Allstate Claims Severity Regression Modeling Stacking Ensemble

  ## Problem Statement
    Allstate Insurance aimed to build a model that can predict the severity of insurance claims based on anonymized policyholder and claim features. The challenge was to optimize for        low error on a continuous regression target (loss), with a heavy focus on feature engineering, ensemble learning, and hyperparameter tuning.
